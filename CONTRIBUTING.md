## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/ahs12/laravel-setanjo.git
cd laravel-setanjo

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Run tests
composer test

# Run code style fixes
composer format
```

## Coding Standards

- Follow **PSR-12** coding standards
- Use **meaningful variable and method names**
- Add **type hints** where possible
- Write **comprehensive tests** for new features
- Keep **backward compatibility** in mind

### Code Style

We use Pint Fixer to maintain consistent code style:

```bash
# Check code style
composer format

```

## Testing

All contributions must include appropriate tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run tests with coverage
composer test-coverage

# Run specific test file
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/SettingsTest.php
```

### Writing Tests

- Use **Pest PHP** for testing
- Test both **happy path and edge cases**
- Include tests for **multi-tenant scenarios**
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

Example test structure:
```php
it('can set and get global settings', function () {
    Settings::set('test_key', 'test_value');
    
    expect(Settings::get('test_key'))->toBe('test_value');
});

it('can set tenant-specific settings', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create();
    
    Settings::for($user)->set('theme', 'dark');
    
    expect(Settings::for($user)->get('theme'))->toBe('dark');
});
```

## Documentation

- Update **README.md** for new features
